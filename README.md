## Energy Price Forecast EU adapter for ioBroker

Electricity price and CO2 forecast for 33 European bidding zones from
[energypriceforecast.eu](https://energypriceforecast.eu/).

Day-ahead prices are only published for the next day. This adapter continues
the series with a forecast of up to 120 hours, so an automation can already
decide today whether to charge the car tonight or wait for tomorrow's cheaper
hours. For every market it also reports the CO2 intensity of the grid.

What you get:

- the current price and CO2 intensity
- the cheapest and the greenest window of a length you choose (e.g. the 3 hours
  your dishwasher runs), with a flag that is `true` while the window is running
- a combined score that ranks the present hour against the coming 24 hours
- the whole price series in 15-minute slots as JSON, for charts and your own logic
- how well the forecast did in the last 30 days, so you can decide how much to trust it

All calculation happens on the server. The adapter polls, maps and writes states.

### Markets

AT, BE, BG, CH, CZ, DE, DK1, DK2, ES, FI, FR, GR, the seven Italian zones (NORD,
CNOR, CSUD, SUD, CALA, SICI, SARD), NL, NO1–NO5, PL, PT, RO, SE1–SE4, SK.

Prices are in the market's currency per kWh as the API reports it (EUR, DKK,
NOK, SEK, ...). By default they are wholesale prices; see
[Household price](#household-price) for what you actually pay.

## Configuration

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Market | Bidding zone. Germany and Luxembourg share one zone. |
| Forecast horizon | 24, 48, 72 or 120 hours. Public access serves up to 48 h. |
| Window length | Hours the cheapest and greenest window should cover, 1–24. |
| Update interval | 15–120 minutes, default 30. Prices change at most every 15 minutes. |
| Prices show | Wholesale price, household price estimate, or own tariff, see below. |
| Postal code | For the estimate in Germany (required) and the Netherlands (optional). |
| Factor, surcharge | For the own tariff. |
| API key | Optional. Only needed for a horizon beyond 48 h. Stored encrypted. |

## Household price

The exchange price is only part of the bill. Three settings decide what the
price states show:

| Setting | What the price states contain | Markets |
|---|---|---|
| Wholesale price | Day-ahead price and its forecast, without any fees or taxes | all |
| Household price estimate | Wholesale price + supplier markup + grid fee + levies, then VAT. In Germany the grid fee comes from the grid operator found by your postal code. | DE, AT, NL, DK1, DK2, NO1–NO5 |
| Own tariff | Wholesale price × factor + surcharge, with your own numbers | all |

For the own tariff, take your contract: the factor is usually 1 + VAT (1.19 in
Germany), the surcharge everything your supplier charges per kWh on top of the
exchange price, including VAT - grid fee, levies and margin. Example for a
German dynamic tariff with 20 ct/kWh on top: factor `1.19`, surcharge `0.20`.

Either way the cheapest window stays the same hours, because every hour gets
the same markup; only the amounts change. Fixed monthly charges are never
included, and the forecast-quality states always stay on the wholesale basis.
A setting that cannot work (e.g. the German estimate without a postal code)
falls back to the wholesale price and says so in the log.

## States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `price.current` | Price of the current slot |
| `price.currentSource` | `day_ahead` (published) or `forecast` |
| `price.bestWindow.start` / `.end` | Cheapest window in the horizon (ISO 8601, UTC) |
| `price.bestWindow.average` | Average price in that window |
| `price.bestWindow.active` | `true` while the cheapest window is running |
| `price.bestWindow.remainingMinutes` | Minutes left while it runs, otherwise `null` |
| `price.bestWindow.status` | `upcoming`, `active` or `passed` |
| `co2.current`, `co2.bestWindow.*` | The same for CO2 intensity (gCO2/kWh) |
| `combined.scoreNow` | Share of the coming 24 h that are worse on price and CO2 than now; 100 = now is the best time |
| `combined.bestWindow.start` / `.end` | Best compromise between cheap and clean |
| `forecast.json` | Price series as `[{start, end, value, source}]` in 15-minute slots |
| `forecast.lastDayAheadSlot` | Where published prices end and the forecast begins |
| `forecast.end` | End of the series |
| `quality.windowExactHitDays` / `.windowEvaluatedDays` | Days in the last 30 on which the forecast found exactly the cheapest window |
| `quality.windowWithinOneHourDays` | Days on which it was at most one hour off |
| `quality.windowMeanExtraCost` | What following the forecast window cost on average compared with the true cheapest one |
| `quality.hourlyMeanAbsError`, `quality.hourlyCorrelation` | Hourly accuracy over 30 days |
| `retail.basis` | `base`, `estimate` or `formula` - what the price states contain |
| `retail.gridArea`, `retail.gridFee`, `retail.supplierMarkup`, `retail.leviesAndTaxes`, `retail.vatPercent` | What the estimate is built from (ct/kWh, øre/kWh in DK and NO) |
| `retail.factor`, `retail.surcharge` | Your own tariff, if that is the basis |
| `info.connection` | Last update succeeded |
| `info.apiKeyState` | `missing` for public access, `valid` with a key, otherwise why the key was refused |

Forecast values for a whole hour are repeated over its four quarters, never
interpolated: the model forecasts hours, and inventing values in between
would change what an automation sees.

## Example: start the dishwasher in the cheapest window

```js
on({ id: 'energypriceforecast.0.price.bestWindow.active', val: true }, () => {
    setState('shelly.0.dishwasher.Relay0.Switch', true);
});
```

## Feedback
